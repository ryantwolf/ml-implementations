# ML-Implementations
This repository contains my personal project of implementing famous machine learning architectures using PyTorch.

## Implemented
- LSTM

## Next up
- Transformer
- Variational Autoencoder

## Notable Ommissions
- Convolutional Neural Network - I have already implemented a convolutional neural network in CUDA for ECE408/CS483 at UIUC.
